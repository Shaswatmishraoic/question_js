## 1. Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.
In many programming languages, including JavaScript, the "==" and "===" operators are used for equality comparisons. The main difference between these two operators lies in how they handle the comparison of values with different data types.

"==" (Equality Operator): The double equals "==" operator performs a loose or abstract equality comparison. It checks if the values being compared are equal after performing type coercion if necessary. Type coercion means that if the two values being compared have different data types, JavaScript will attempt to convert them to a common type before making the comparison. For example:
5 == "5"   // true, as JavaScript converts the string to a number before comparing
true == 1  // true, as JavaScript converts the boolean to a number (true=1) before comparing
The "==" operator is more permissive and may lead to unexpected results due to its type coercion behavior. It tries to make the values comparable by implicitly converting one or both of them.

"===" (Strict Equality Operator): The triple equals "===" operator performs a strict equality comparison. It checks if the values being compared are not only equal in value but also have the same data type. Unlike the "==" operator, it does not perform type coercion. For example:
5 === "5"   // false, as the types are different (number vs. string)
true === 1  // false, as the types are different (boolean vs. number)
The "===" operator is more reliable when you want to ensure both the value and the data type are identical.

In general, it is recommended to use the "===" operator for equality comparisons in JavaScript, as it provides more predictable and less error-prone behavior. It avoids unintended type conversions and helps maintain code clarity. However, there may be cases where the "==" operator is intentionally used for specific type coercion scenarios or when you explicitly want to allow different types to be considered equal.
## 2. What are the differences between var, let and const?
In JavaScript, var, let, and const are used to declare variables, but they differ in terms of their scope, hoisting behavior, and mutability.

var:

Variables declared with var have function-level scope or global scope, meaning they are accessible throughout the entire function or, if declared outside a function, they become global variables.
var declarations are hoisted to the top of their scope, which means you can access and use the variable before it is declared. However, its value will be undefined until it is assigned.
var allows variable redeclaration within the same scope, which can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs.
var variables can be reassigned new values at any time.
Example:
function example() {
  var x = 10;
  if (true) {
    var x = 20; // Redeclaration of x
    console.log(x); // 20
  }
  console.log(x); // 20
}
let:

Variables declared with let have block-level scope, meaning they are limited to the nearest enclosing block (a block is typically defined by curly braces {}).
let declarations are hoisted to the top of their block, but unlike var, they are not accessible before their declaration. This behavior is known as the "temporal dead zone."
let variables can be reassigned new values, allowing them to change throughout the block they are defined in.
let does not allow redeclaration of the same variable within the same block scope, preventing potential errors.
Example:
function example() {
  let x = 10;
  if (true) {
    let x = 20; // New variable x, scoped to the if block
    console.log(x); // 20
  }
  console.log(x); // 10
}
const:

Variables declared with const also have block-level scope.
const variables are similar to let, but they must be assigned a value at the time of declaration and cannot be reassigned afterward.
const variables are read-only, meaning their assigned value cannot be changed. However, for objects and arrays, the properties or elements within them can still be modified.
const does not allow redeclaration of the same variable within the same block scope.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
function example() {
  const x = 10;
  if (true) {
    const x = 20; // New variable x, scoped to the if block
    console.log(x); // 20
  }
  console.log(x); // 10
}
In general, it is recommended to use let for variables that need to be reassigned and const for variables that should remain constant. This helps enforce immutability and improves code clarity. Using var should be avoided in modern JavaScript development due to its less predictable scoping behavior and potential for errors.
## 3. What is hoisting?
Hoisting is a behavior in JavaScript where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase, before the code is executed. This means that regardless of where the declarations are made in the code, they are effectively "hoisted" to the top of their scope.

Hoisting applies to both var and function declarations, but not to let and const declarations.

Here are a few key points about hoisting:

Variable Hoisting:

With var declarations, the variable name is hoisted to the top of its scope, and the initialization or assignment remains in place. The variable is effectively accessible throughout the entire scope, even before the actual declaration in the code. However, the value will be undefined until the assignment is encountered.
Example:
console.log(x); // undefined
var x = 10;
console.log(x); // 10
Function Hoisting:

Function declarations, regardless of whether they have parameters, are entirely hoisted to the top of their scope. They can be called anywhere within the scope, even before the declaration itself.
Example:
greet(); // "Hello"
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello");
}
## 4. What is a Temporal Dead Zone?
The Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) is a behavior in JavaScript that occurs with variables declared using let and const before they are formally declared in the code. It is a specific time span within a scope where variables exist but cannot be accessed or referenced due to being in an uninitialized state.

Here are some key points to understand the Temporal Dead Zone:

TDZ and Accessing Variables:

When a block scope is entered, variables declared with let and const are hoisted to the top of their respective scopes. However, unlike variables declared with var, they are not assigned a value and remain uninitialized until their actual declaration is encountered in the code.
During the TDZ, attempting to access or reference a variable declared with let or const results in a ReferenceError.
Example:
console.log(x); // ReferenceError: x is not defined
let x = 10;
TDZ and Temporal Dead Zone:

The TDZ is the period between the start of the scope and the actual declaration of the variable. Within this zone, any attempt to access or reference the variable will throw a ReferenceError.
The TDZ ends once the variable declaration is reached in the code, and the variable becomes accessible and usable.
Example:
function example() {
  console.log(x); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'x' before initialization
  let x = 10;
  console.log(x); // 10
}
example();
Purpose of the Temporal Dead Zone:

The TDZ was introduced to prevent accidental usage of variables before they are properly declared and initialized. It encourages explicit declaration and helps catch potential errors at an early stage.
The TDZ promotes code clarity and enforces better coding practices by ensuring variables are used only when they are intended to be used, after they have been properly declared and initialized.
## 5. What is meant by first class functions
In programming languages, the concept of "first-class functions" refers to the ability of treating functions as first-class citizens. This means that functions can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as values from functions, just like any other data types such as numbers, strings, or objects.

Here are some characteristics and benefits of first-class functions:

Assigning Functions to Variables:

Functions can be assigned to variables just like any other value. The variable then becomes a reference to the function.
Example:
const greet = function() {
  console.log("Hello!");
};

greet(); // "Hello!"
Passing Functions as Arguments:

Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions. This allows for higher-order functions, which are functions that operate on other functions.
Example:
function execute(callback) {
  console.log("Executing...");
  callback();
}

function greet() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}

execute(greet); // "Executing..." followed by "Hello!"
## 6. What are pure functions?
Pure functions are functions that have two main characteristics:

Deterministic: A pure function always produces the same output for the same input, regardless of the state of the program or any external factors. It relies only on its input parameters to generate the output and does not have any hidden dependencies or side effects.

Side Effect-Free: A pure function does not cause any observable side effects, such as modifying global variables, modifying the input parameters, performing I/O operations, or interacting with the external world (e.g., network requests, database queries). It operates solely on its inputs and returns a new value as output.
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
## 7. What is creation phase and execution phase?
In JavaScript, the terms "creation phase" and "execution phase" are related to the process of interpreting and executing code. They are commonly associated with the concept of the "execution context" and the steps taken by JavaScript's runtime environment to prepare for code execution.

Creation Phase:

During the creation phase, the JavaScript runtime sets up the environment for code execution.
The creation phase involves two important steps: variable and function hoisting.
Variable Hoisting: All variable declarations (using var) and function declarations are moved to the top of their respective scopes. This allows variables and functions to be accessed and used before their actual declarations in the code. However, only the declarations are hoisted, not the assignments or initializations.
Function Hoisting: Function declarations are hoisted entirely, including the function body. This means that functions can be called anywhere within the scope, even before their actual declaration in the code.
During the creation phase, the JavaScript engine also sets up the scope chain, establishes the value of this, and performs other necessary setup operations.
Execution Phase:

Once the creation phase is completed, the execution phase begins.
In the execution phase, the JavaScript engine starts executing the code line by line, from top to bottom.
Variables that were hoisted are assigned their initial values, and functions are now available for invocation.
During the execution phase, the JavaScript engine evaluates expressions, assigns values, calls functions, and executes statements based on the order in the code.
It's important to note that the creation phase and execution phase are not explicitly specified in the ECMAScript specification. Instead, these terms are used to explain the conceptual steps that occur during the initialization and execution of JavaScript code.

Understanding the creation and execution phases can help in grasping concepts such as hoisting, scope, and the order of code execution. It provides insight into how JavaScript prepares for and executes code within the runtime environment.
